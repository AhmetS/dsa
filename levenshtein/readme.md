#Levenshtein Distance

The *Levenshtein distance* is a metric for measuring the difference between two strings. It is defined as the minimum number of edits required to transform one string into the other. Allowable operations are insertion, deletion or substitution.

The distance between two strings, is the same when both strings are reversed.
